# Goal

Create a web app (no backend necessary) that will let the user create a "ToDo" list.

# Functionalities

1. Create a new task
2. Delete a task
3. Mark a task as complete/incomplete

# Optional Functionalities

1. Item Reordering
2. Item Renaming
3. Due Date

# Time Limit - 3 hours

# Other details

To build the web app you can use either vanilla javascript or a framework (preferably React or Vue).  We do not expect you to spend a lot of time on this, the design should be very simple.  We would like the code itself to be well commented, to help us understand your thought process.

# How to submit
