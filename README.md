# Goal

Create a web app (no backend necessary) that will let the user create a "ToDo" list.

# Functionalities

1. Create a new task
2. Delete a task
3. Mark a task as complete/incomplete

# Other details

To build the web app you can use either vanilla javascript or a framework (preferably React or Vue).  We do not expect you to spend a lot of time on this, the design should be very simple.  We would like the code itself to be well commented, to help us understand your thought process.  We would also like you to include a brief readme that includes a development plan.
